I was born in Genova, Italy in 1995.

I studied at the University of Genova and graduated with a Master's Degree in Physics in 2019.
I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Genova with a scholarship funded by INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare). My institutional webpage can be found [here](https://www.difi.unige.it/en/department/people/vicenzi-matteo).

In my free time, I'm an admin and bureaucrat of Tolkienpedia ([lotr.fandom.com/it](https://www.lotr.fandom.com/it)), a fan-based no-profit italian wiki on Tolkien and his fantasy universe hosted by FANDOM. My user profile can be found [here](https://lotr.fandom.com/it/wiki/Utente:Daeron_del_Doriath).
