I was born in Genova, Italy in 1995.

I studied at the University of Genova and graduated with a Master's Degree in Physics in 2019.
I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Genova with a scholarship funded by INFN (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare).

In my spare time, I'm a [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com/) [IVT Helper](https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Community_Central:International), monitoring and providing support to fan-based Italian wikis to develop content and grow user engagement.

I'm also an admin at [Tolkienpedia](https://lotr.fandom.com/it/wiki/Pagina_principale), the italian wiki on Tolkien's legendarium hosted by Fandom, having joined the project back in 2011.
